# AI-Object-Detection-System-for-FPV-Drone
I'll help you create an AI-enabled object detection system for FPV drones in C++. This will be a comprehensive system using OpenCV and a deep learning framework.I've created a comprehensive AI-enabled object detection system for FPV drones in C++. Here are the key features:

## Core Features:

1. **Real-time Object Detection**: Uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) neural network for fast, accurate object detection
2. **FPV-Optimized**: Low-latency processing with frame skipping options and minimal buffering
3. **Drone-Specific HUD**: Crosshair, target indicators, distance estimation, and bearing calculations
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time FPS display and performance controls

## Key Components:

- **FPVObjectDetector Class**: Main class handling all detection logic
- **Detection Struct**: Stores object detection results (class, confidence, bounding box)
- **DroneTarget Struct**: FPV-specific target information (center, distance, bearing)
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized for minimal latency critical for drone operations

## FPV-Specific Features:

- **Crosshair Display**: Central targeting reticle
- **Target Analysis**: Distance and bearing estimation for detected objects
- **Low Latency Mode**: Frame skipping and buffer optimization
- **HUD Overlay**: Essential flight information display
- **Performance Controls**: Runtime adjustment of detection parameters

## Setup Requirements:

You'll need to download these files:
1. **yolov4.weights** - Pre-trained YOLO model weights
2. **yolov4.cfg** - YOLO network configuration
3. **coco.names** - Object class names file

Download from the official YOLO repository: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet

## Compilation:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 fpv_detector.cpp -o fpv_detector `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`
```

## Controls:
- **'q'**: Quit application
- **'s'**: Save screenshot
- **'p'**: Toggle low-latency mode

The system is designed for real-time performance with features specifically useful for FPV drone operations like target tracking, distance estimation, and minimal display latency. You can extend it further by adding features like GPS integration, autonomous navigation waypoints, or specific object tracking for drone racing or surveillance applications.
